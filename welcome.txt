Synology VideoStation and MediaServer ffmpeg wrapper with DTS, EAC3 and TrueHD support. 
It enables hardware transcoding from Synology´s ffmpeg for video and transcoding DTS, HEVC, EAC3, AAC, True HD from the ffmpeg of the SynoCommunity. 
When you use this SynoCommunity´s ffmpeg, you will have AAC 5.1 512kbps Surround and another audio track 2.0 MP3 Stereo for Chromecast or GoogleTV or other clients that don´t accept 5.1 AAC.

Works fine the OffLine transcoding and the streaming of tipical extensions like: MKV, MP4, AVI... Works fine the thumbnails in VideoStation.

This wrapper is a fork of BenjaminPoncet rev.12 with a few changes, fixes and some improvements in his code. The latest version is 12.3.3 for DSM 7.1 and 12.2.2 for DSM 7.0.
You will have full control of each parameter. The only wrapper of Internet with 5.1 AAC support, ENJOY!!!
