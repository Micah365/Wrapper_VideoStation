==================== Wrapper for VideoStation and DLNA MediaServer for DTS, EAC3 and TrueHD with transcoding to AAC 5.1: ====================
Synology VideoStation and MediaServer ffmpeg wrapper with DTS, EAC3 and TrueHD support. 
It enables hardware transcoding from Synology's ffmpeg for video and transcoding DTS, HEVC, EAC3, AAC, True HD from the ffmpeg of the SynoCommunity. 

When the Wrapper needs to transcoding you will have 2 audio's streams from the SAME track:
- In DLNA MediaServer = [1) AAC 5.1 512kbps AND 2) MP3 2.0 256kbps.] (by default)
- In  VIDEO-STATION   = [1) MP3 2.0 256kbp  AND 2) AAC 5.1 512kbps.] (by default)
(For Chromecast or Google TV or other clients that don´t accept 5.1 AAC neither multi audio's stream support, the MP3 2.0 is the first audio stream in VIDEO-STATION due to this incompatibility).

Works fine the OffLine transcoding and the streaming of tipical extensions like: MKV, MP4, AVI... Works fine the thumbnails in VideoStation.

The latest version is 12.3.3 for DSM 7.1 and 12.2.2 for DSM 7.0.
You will have full control of each Audio's codecs parameter using the Configuration TOOL for the Advanced Wrapper Mode. The only wrapper of Internet with 5.1 AAC support and with a Configurator TOOL.
